#ZE WEATHER APP v2

Check the weather in Tikrit! Spoiler: it's super warm.
You can also search other places. If they don't exist...nothing much will happen.
I should probably have a function for that. 

New in V2: 

The weather for the next 24hrs will be visible in three-hour increments ðŸ˜®

removed the vuex store, or any code therein at least, everything now originates from the Home.vue component.
